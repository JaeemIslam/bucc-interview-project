It's a basic Calculator App built only using Java. This calculator can do summation, substraction, multiplication and divition operation between two rational numbers. Other than these, it can also perform negation, square root and percentage calculation on any rational number. And lastly it has a "All Clear" button which refreshes the display. 

# Language Used: Java

# Steps to Build:
1. First a frame is created.
2. In the frame, there are two panels. Display panel and Buttons panel. To show the numbers, operation symbols on the display panel, there is Label in it. This label shows the actions of buttons through the display.
3. And the buttons panel, it's laid out in a 5 by 4 grid format. So 20 buttons are created in the buttons panel. Each of the buttons has properties according to their action.
4. Then specified actions were assigned to each buttons using "ActionListener".
5. And lastly through using multiple loops, logical expressions and methods the buttons were assigned thoroughly with there functions.

# Steps to run:
1. Download both calculator.java and App.java file in a single forder.
2. Open the folder in a Java compiler (VS Code , IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Click open both calculator.java and App.java files and select "run java" from run options for calculator.java and select App.java as main class.

This will compile and run the calculator.

# Unsolved Bug:
The calculator cannot perform continuous algebraic operations without pressing the "=" button.
